The above video tutorial and subsequent text was created in approximately 6 hours, for the purpose of consolidating and converting multiple Unity+Oculus development documentation pages into a video tutorial with only one subsequent page of documentation. The following is the technical writing documentation of how I would write "Tutorial: build your first VR app" for the Oculus Rift. 

At the bottom is a summary of my experience follwing the existing documentation (and a list of the documentation I used), along with the problems I encountered (and overcame) along the way. 

### Build Your Simple Application 

In this tutorial we're going to create a simple game comprised of moving a ball within a play area. We'll create some walls so the ball doesn't roll out of the play area, in addition to attaching a controller script so we can move the ball around with our keyboard. At the end, we'll enable VR support so we can play our creation on Rift. 


### Step 1: Set Up Your Rift

Before you can make a game for Rift in Unity, you need to ensure your Rift is set up properly. Follow the instructions at [Oculus.com/setup](https://www.oculus.com/setup/) to get your Rift running in working order. Once this is completed, be sure that you're using Unity 5 to create your VR Game ([you can check compatibility and version requirements and recommendations  here](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/)).

### Step 2: Build a Play Area and Add a Player 

1. Launch Unity Hub, and create "new". Once there, select 3D, and give it a name. We'll call it VR Game.
