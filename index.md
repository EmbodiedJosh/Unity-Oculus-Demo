The above video tutorial and subsequent text was created in approximately 6 hours, for the purpose of consolidating and converting multiple Unity+Oculus development documentation pages into a video tutorial with only one subsequent page of documentation. The following documentation details my process of:

* Creating my first VR app 
* The documentation I used to create it
* The problems I encountered (and overcame) along the way. 

### Step 1

I began by following the instructions listed in the original ["Tutorial: Build Your First VR App"](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-tutorial/?locale=en_US) documentation, and followed the first step of [Preparing for Rift Development](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-pcprep/)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EmbodiedJosh/UnityOculusDemo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
