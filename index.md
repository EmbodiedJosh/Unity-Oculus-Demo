[![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/626114024655945740/626464011193417730/oculsu-rift-unity-pro-1021x580.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tPHnLJ__Cd4)



The above video tutorial and subsequent text was created in approximately 6 hours, for the purpose of consolidating and converting multiple Unity+Oculus development documentation pages into a video tutorial with only one subsequent page of documentation. The following documentation details my process of:

-Creating my first VR app 
-The documentation I used to create it
-The problems I encountered (and overcame) along the way. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EmbodiedJosh/UnityOculusDemo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
